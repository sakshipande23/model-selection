# Machine Learning Model Selection
This repository contains the code and files for selecting a machine learning model using the AirQuality dataset. The aim of this project is to predict the AirQuality category based on the provided features.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the AirQuality.csv dataset. It contains several features related to air quality, and the target variable is the AirQuality category.

# Steps
1. Importing libraries: This step involves importing the necessary libraries and dependencies required for the machine learning model selection process.
2. Importing dataset: In this step, the AirQuality.csv dataset is imported into the project. Make sure to provide instructions on how to access and download the dataset.
3. Preprocessing of dataset: This step involves performing preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and 
   splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
